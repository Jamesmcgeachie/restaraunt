This restaurant app was built over several weeks at Bitmaker, learning new ways to add features as we went deeper with Rails.

Building the Foundation: 

"This week, your mission is to have your first set of restaurant models completed and confirmed working in the Rails console, as per our lesson and screencast. Here's a guideline as to what you should have so far:

    You should have at least 2 models: Restaurant, and CuisineType
    Restaurants should belong to one cuisine type
    A cuisine type has many restaurants
    Restaurants must have a name and capacity before they are saved
    Cuisine types must have a name before the can be saved"
